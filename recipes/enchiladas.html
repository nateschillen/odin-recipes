        Say hello to my all-time favorite chicken enchiladas. ♡
        This chicken enchilada recipe was actually one of the first-ever posts that 
        I shared here on Gimme Some Oven back in 2009. And now, more than a decade later, 
        it still continues to be one of the recipes I make most often for dinner here in our house
         — and one of the recipes that our readers make most often too! I’m so happy you all continue to enjoy it!
        For those of you who are new to this recipe, these Tex-Mex style chicken enchiladas are easy 
        to make with a basic filling of sautéed chicken, green chiles, onions, beans and shredded cheese. 
        Then they are rolled up in your choice of either flour or corn tortillas, baked until hot and melty, 
        and sprinkled with lots of fresh toppings. But I have to say that the real magic of this recipe lies in 
        the homemade red enchilada sauce that brings it all together. This red enchilada sauce only requires a few extra minutes of prep time, but the flavor that it adds to these enchiladas is major. Sooo much better than the canned stuff!
